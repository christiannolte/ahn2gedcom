# ahn2gedcom

Is a converter that converts genealogy Files from a format, that was used by a Data Becker Software called Familienchronik into the gedcom format.

The Software requires Python. It can be started by calling the file filereader.py.

This file requests the filename of the *.AHN file to be imported.
Some general checks will be performed like:

- Check for persons with unknown gender
- Check for persons with a "slash" in the given name


Theese checks are made to correct errors in a AHN file, that was generated by my father.
